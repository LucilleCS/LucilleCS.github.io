        <h2>Parts Of a Keyboard</h2>
        <p>There are about 6 pieces of information if you are trying to build a computer. <br>
           <b>The keyboard case</b>, case is your outer shell or how your keyboard base will look, feel free to choose 
           a favoite color or material (wood,glass,plastic, etc.).
           your <b>PCB</b> is where your switches are mounted and connected (where the electrical components that allow your keys to be pressed). 
           The <b>plate </b> locks your keys in place. 
           the <b>stabilizers</b> stabilize/prevent wobbling in your bigger keys such as space, enter, shift or tab. 
           your <b>switches </b>are the heart of the typing experience and can make a difference in your preference. 
           your <b>keycaps </b> are how your keys (a-z and numbers) will look, they dont necessarily have anything to do with how your keys feel besides texture.

        <h2>keyboard switches</h2>
        <p> Picking switches can be difficult, they come in different colors and feels. 
            However they are categorized into three main feels. <b>Linear</b> switches are known 
            to be more smooth and easier to press down on. 
            <b>Tactile </b>is a mix of linear and clicky, where you can feel a bump when you press your keys. 
            People who like to know if they are pressing/registering the key they pressed are more likely to like these switches. 
            <b>Clicky </b>switches are loud and have a heavy feel. Theyâ€™re good for people who like hearing keyboard sounds.
